This is a team project worked by 2 members using arduino uno microcontroller 

 **Objective of the Project**
 
  Visually impaired people are the people who find it difficult to recognize the smallest detail
with healthy eyes. The objectives of this research work include as follows:
• To develop prototype hardware for the modern blind stick.
• To help blind people navigate the route at their best.
• To reduce the risk of injuries and loss for the visually impaired person.
• To create suitable software for the visually impaired person.
To design assistive technology for visually impaired people that can detect obstacles and
provide alternative routes for the blind. Through this smart blind stick, visually impaired people
will have so much assistance. In case of any problem, with the function of the Glothe bal
Positioning System (GPS), we can track their whereabouts.

** Problem Statement**

 Blind people can’t easily recognize obstacles or stairs while using a normal blind stick
 No safety features on the normal blind stick.
 Can’t locate the location of the normal blind stick user when they are having an
emergency problem or are lost in a public area.

** Significance of the Project**

  To prevent and reduce the risk of injuries and loss of the visually impaired person.
